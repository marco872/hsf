	<u><h5> Who We Are:</h5></u>
	<p> We are ordinary people,  who believe that UNESCO's 17 Sustainable Development Goals will improve our lives. We advocate holistic action to challenge current social inequality, climate change and poverty. We want to build a greener and more just world to give back to our planet what we have unfairly taken from it over the past hundred years.</p>
	<br/><br/>
	<hr/><br/>
	<u><h5> What do we do:</h5></u>
	<p>Is a global change in our lifestyle too abstract a topic to discuss?. Most of us know that imagining better human behavior toward nature produces positive results. In fact, companies with well-rounded sustainable programs are the ones that win in the marketplace. Consequently, it is the more conservative corporate approaches that need to be transformed.  This open-source platform aims to introduce  emerging holistic concepts and innovations, and to help the grassroots organizations with donations.</p>

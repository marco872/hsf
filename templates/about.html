	<u><h5> Who We Are:</h5></u>
	<p> We are the new people. We offer an open source platform to those who want to present new ideas for a better living. To those who want to change the world using a holistic approach , which includes social justice, technique and creativity. To those who not only want to improve the way we live, but who want to give back to our planet what we have unjustly taken from it over the past hundred years.<strong><em>We All are the new people.</em></strong></p>
	<br/><br/>
	<hr/><br/>
	<u><h5> Wha do we do:</h5></u>
	<p>Is a global change in our lifestyle too innovative a topic to discuss? Perhaps for some it is, but they are the ones who consider it unproductive, not us. Most of us know that imagining more produces positive results. As a result, new companies with 360-degree sustainable innovative programs are the ones that win in the marketplace. Consequently, it is the more conservative business approaches that need to be transformed, and <strong><em>this open source platform aims to introduce these emerging holistic concepts.</em></strong></p>
